# Methods-of-efficient-programming
 This Repository is about to compare the runtime for different methods of efficient and inefficient programming. 
 There are few examples, wich you can run to get the results:
 
1. An implementation of an Decorator Pattern with the associated AntiPattern for Innerclasses and Subclasses. To compare the runtime of an specific call you have to run the "ComparePattern" Class. There are 2 examples which are executed. One is without and one with an extra calculation for the concrete Component, wich will be decoratet.
 
2. The recursive implementation of the fibunacci sequence with and without the using of caching and also the iterative implementation of it. To get the results you have to run the "Fibunacci" Class.

3. The call of an function, wich calculates the square of two numbers with and without inlining. To get the results of the compare you have to run the "Inlining" Class.

4. An example implementation, wich compares the use of an loop and loop unrolling. To get the results you have to run the "LoopUnrolling" Class.

5. The recursion and iterative version of the factorial function. To get the results you have to run the "RecursionIteration" Class. 


Note: Sometimes the Compiler takes over the optimization automatically. Because of that I recommend to check this and look in the specific Bytecode.
